# How does it work?

THe app utilizes multiple API's to help users find their closest Breweries and new beer to try. This is made possible by multiple technologies including jQuery, BootStrap, Foundations, Firebase, Google API's, BreweryDB API's and most of all hard work. The features included are an index page where users can enter a zip code to generate a list of breweries in a 5km radius. In addition, the index page also allows users look through a limited selection of popular beer types to find new ones to try! Some extra features include a chat section where users can chat or simply leave a comment as well as a contact page where users can email any inquiries they may have.
